 **# Budgeting Allocation Application**

**## Overview**

This React application is a budgeting tool that allows users to manage their budget allocations across different categories. It was developed as the final assignment for the "Developing Front-End Apps with React" course on Coursera.

**## Key Features**

    - Users can allocate funds to different categories.
    - Validation ensures only valid numerical values are entered.
    - Allocations cannot exceed the remaining budget.
- **Editable Budget Value:**
    - Users can directly edit the overall budget value.
    - Increment and decrement buttons provide convenient adjustments.
    - Validation enforces a maximum budget of 20,000 and a minimum budget that covers spending.
- **Currency Management:**
    - A dropdown menu allows users to select their preferred currency.
    - Currency prefixes are displayed for budget values and allocation inputs.
    - Currency conversion is dynamically applied when the currency selection changes.
- **Category-Specific Controls:**
